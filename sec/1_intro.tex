\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The University of Waterloo Robotics Team (UWRT) is a dynamic, student-led team of over 50 members from engineering, math, and science programs, including Mechatronics Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, and Computer Science. A multifaceted group with 70\% of members joining to extend diverse backgrounds of highschool robotics enrichment in FIRST, VEX and other forms, UWRT members are inspired by real world applications of robotics with tangible lasting impacts. In the past, the team has participated in the Autonomous Robot Racing competition, mini sumo competition, Intelligent Ground Vehicle competition, and has participated in the University Rover Challenge as our main competition since 2010. UWRT Alumni go on to found industry leading robotics organizations, fostering  team history that ripples through and connects current members to exciting opportunities.

This year, the team adopted a streamlined two-level hierarchy to enhance collaboration. Team Leads oversee high-level rover architecture, system integration, roadmapping, and external communications. Subteam Leads focus on subsystem implementation and onboarding, ensuring that member designs align with the team’s objectives. New members benefit from onboarding training, shadowing opportunities, and personalized mentorship from Subteam Leads. UWRT actively participates in Open House events and community outreach initiatives, inspiring future generations through programs and tours for elementary and middle school students, proudly representing the University of Waterloo and its mission. 

The team operates out of a dedicated design bay in the University of Waterloo’s engineering building, equipped with tools such as 3D printers and soldering stations. Additional support from university facilities, including the machine shop and paint room, enables complex manufacturing. Funding is sourced from university organizations such as WEEF and EngSoc, along with industry sponsors, supporting prototyping, testing, and team operations. A financial statement is detailed in Table 1.
