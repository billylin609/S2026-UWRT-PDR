\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The University of Waterloo Robotics Team (UWRT) is a student-led team of over 30 members from Mechatronics Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, Computer Science, and related programs, with 70\% bringing prior robotics experience from FIRST, VEX, and high-school science clubs. The team operates under a three-level organizational structure shown in Figure \ref{fig:uwrt_team_structure}: a Team Lead and Business Lead manage external relations and sponsorships, a Safety Captain ensures regulatory compliance, an Architecture Decision Committee of senior members oversees technical decisions, and general members contribute across mechanical, electrical, firmware, software, and business subteams. To build team capabilities, we implement subteam-specific onboarding training followed by peer-mentoring partnerships between new and senior members. Our outreach efforts include co-hosting local hackathons, participating in regional and national conferences, and engaging with university open-houses and high schools to inspire the next generation of robotics enthusiasts.

%The University of Waterloo Robotics Team (UWRT) is a dynamic, student-led team of over 30 members from engineering, math, and science programs, including Mechatronics Engineering, Systems Design Engineering, and Computer Science. A multifaceted group with 70\% of members joining to extend diverse backgrounds of highschool robotics enrichment in FIRST, VEX and other forms, UWRT members are inspired by real world applications of robotics with tangible lasting impacts. 

%The team operates under a three-level hierarchy: the Team Lead coordinates with administrators and sponsors, the Safety Captain managed safety requirements and trainings, and the Business Lead take care of the outreach and relations with other organization. An Architecture Decision Committee of senior members approves all major architectural decisions, with general team members supporting across five functional subteams: mechanical, electrical, firmware, software, and business. The team structures can be visulized in figure \ref{fig:uwrt_team_structure}. 

%Our team is committed to prompt robotics education through multiple outreach initiatives. We co-host local hackathons, participate in regional and national conferences, and engage with the university open-house and local high schools to inspire the next generation of robotics enthusiasts. 

%To highlight our recruitment efforts, we actively participate in university open-house events and host dedicated recruitment sessions. New members complete subteam-specific onboarding training to familiarize themselves with our pipeline and utilities. We then implement a peer-mentoring system that pairs new members with senior team members, enabling collaborative learning and knowledge transfer.
