\section{Project Management and Planning}
\label{sec:plan}

Since the release of the URC 2026 requirements, UWRT has commenced its rover development cycle, structured into three stages: Research and Development from July to December , focusing on identifying previous competition cycle shortcomings, high-risk issues during system testing and developing proofs of concept; The team's Manufacturing and build phase commences in January through February, dedicated to assembly and integration of  the new and improved  system; and a Testing phase from March to May, where systems are validated individually and in mock competition environments.  
A defined approach to system integration involving requirements definition, early feature testing, functionality testing in controlled environments, and final testing is implemented. This process serves to mitigate the struggles of integrating independently developed subsystems and ensures that the entire robot is intently designed to satisfy competition requirements. Figure 3 outlines this timeline through a Gantt chart. Efficient collaboration is achieved using Confluence for tracking meeting minutes, architectural, and design decisions.  Online platforms such as GitHub and Kenesto host the team’s development files.
